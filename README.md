<h3 align="center">A Web and Mobile Developer</h3>

I'm Satria Bahari, a student majoring in Information Systems at the University of Jambi. I have a strong interest in frontend development. With a solid foundation in JavaScript and TypeScript, as well as a comprehensive understanding of various frontend libraries and frameworks, I have navigated the ever-evolving landscape of web development with enthusiasm and dedication.

I focus on creating web applications that not only provide precise experiences but are also user-friendly. My specialization includes JavaScript and TypeScript, along with frameworks such as React, Vite, and Next.js. As a quick learner and adaptive thinker, I thrive in a dynamic environment where innovation is a driving force. My collaborative nature allows me to seamlessly integrate with teams, contributing not only to my technical skills but also embodying a humble attitude that values input from every team member.
